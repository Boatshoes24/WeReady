# WeReady


I've been playing WoW for a long time now and am about to return to school for programming, 
so I decided I'd like to get a foot in the door and start learning some lua. This has led me to 
creating my first ever addon! This addon will add some additional slash commands to perform a 
ready check if you are group leader or assist, but will also give you a notification in chat if you are neither. 
```
Commands: 
/wr
/rc 
/rdy 
/readycheck (already in game I think, but it will now output the not in group message).
```
Hopefully as I get better with this I can add some additional features in the future or completely new addons! 
Thanks a ton if you happen to check this out and feel free to let me know what you think!
